# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post on my new personal website. I've built this using **Hugo** for the static site generation and **Tailwind CSS** for styling.

## Features

This blog includes several features:

- **Dark mode toggle** - A circular button in the navbar that remembers your preference
- **Minimal design** - Clean, monospaced typography using JetBrains Mono
- **Responsive layout** - Works well on all device sizes
- **Markdown support** - Full Markdown rendering with proper typography

## Code Example

Here's a simple code example:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('World'));
```

## Lists

You can create both ordered and unordered lists:

### Unordered List
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

### Ordered List
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

## Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote. It's great for highlighting important information or quotes.

## Links

You can include [links](https://example.com) in your content.

## Conclusion

This blog is now ready for more content. I'll be writing about various topics including technology, programming, and other interests.

Stay tuned for more posts!
