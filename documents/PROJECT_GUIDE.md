# Project Guide

This document explains what each important file/folder does, what technologies are used, and how to run and deploy the site.

## Technologies

- Hugo (static site generator)
- Tailwind CSS via CDN (with Typography plugin)
- Vanilla JavaScript for small interactivity (dark mode toggle, search/filter)
- Google Fonts: JetBrains Mono

## Repository layout

Top-level

- `hugo.toml`: Site configuration (title, theme, params, menus, goldmark/renderer options). Also contains server headers for local dev.
- `README.md`: Quick usage guide (tech stack, run/deploy).
- `docs/PROJECT_GUIDE.md`: This document.
- `public/`: Build output (generated by `hugo`). Do not edit; it's regenerated each build.

Content

- `content/blog/`: Markdown posts. Each file becomes a blog post.
- `archetypes/default.md`: Default front matter template when creating new content.

Assets & Styling

- `static/css/site.css`: Central stylesheet for navbar (animated underline), dark mode toggle, blog list/single, projects, utilities (`.section-tight`, `.section-gap`, `.projects-grid`), social icon styles, theme transition, tag chips, and tabs animation.
- `static/images/`: Static images (e.g., profile picture). Referenced with `/images/...` URLs.
- Favicons & PWA files in `static/`:
  - `apple-touch-icon.png`, `favicon-32x32.png`, `favicon-16x16.png`, `android-chrome-192x192.png`, `android-chrome-512x512.png`
  - `site.webmanifest`, `safari-pinned-tab.svg`

Static pages

- `static/index.html`: Home page (intro + social icons).
- `static/projects.html`: Projects page (cards with tags/links).
- `static/resume.pdf`: Your résumé.

Hugo layouts (theme)

- `themes/minimal-blog/layouts/_default/baseof.html`: Shared base HTML (head, nav, main, footer) used by most pages. Includes Tailwind CDN (Typography), fonts, favicons/manifest, dark-mode script, and links `site.css`.
- `themes/minimal-blog/layouts/blog/baseof.html`: Unified wrapper for blog pages with the same head/meta, transitions, and dark-mode behavior.
- `themes/minimal-blog/layouts/blog/list.html`: Blog index page. Heading, search input, two-mode filter (title/tags) with smooth button transitions, and date-first list rows.
- `themes/minimal-blog/layouts/blog/single.html`: Single post view with right-aligned “back to all posts,” title, date, clickable tags, `prose` content, previous/next links, and centered “back to top”.

Build tooling

- `package.json`, `postcss.config.js`, `tailwind.config.js`: Present for potential local processing but not required for the current CDN-based setup.

## How to run locally

Prerequisite: Install Hugo (extended): `https://gohugo.io/getting-started/install/`.

1. Start the dev server (shows drafts):

```bash
hugo server -D
# http://localhost:1313
```

2. Create a new post (fastest):

```bash
hugo new blog/my-post.md
```

Or create a file manually under `content/blog/` and add front matter:

```toml
+++
title = "My Post"
date = 2025-02-26T12:00:00Z
draft = false
tags = ["Hugo", "Personal"]
+++
```

3. Images: put them under `static/images/` and reference as `/images/filename.jpg`.

4. Social links (home page icons): edit `href` values in `static/index.html`.

5. Site title and description: edit `title` and `[params]` in `hugo.toml`.

## How to build

```bash
hugo
# output in ./public
```

## How to deploy

Option A — Any static hosting

1. Build: `hugo`
2. Upload the `public/` directory to your host

Option B — GitHub Pages (build locally)

1. `hugo` to build
2. Push `public/` to a `gh-pages` branch
3. In repo settings → Pages, select the `gh-pages` branch and `/` root

Option C — GitHub Pages (CI/CD)

- Add a workflow that:
  - Runs `hugo` on pushes to `main`
  - Publishes the `public/` folder to GitHub Pages

Option D — Netlify / Vercel / Cloudflare Pages

- Connect this repository
- Build command: `hugo`
- Publish directory: `public`

## Notes

- Future-dated posts: either set `date` to today or start the server with `hugo server -D -F`.
- The blog list search is client-side and uses data attributes (`data-title`, `data-tags`).
- The site uses dark mode with a small JS toggle and scoped transitions to reduce repaint jitter.
- The head of all pages now includes favicon and PWA tags; drop your icon files into `static/` to activate.
